# Design-of-Safety-Control-System-Accident-Detection-in-Car

FEATURES
● Accelerometer Sensor:
We are using the accelerometer sensor to detect if an accident
happened or not at this particular time. We can fix the threshold
voltages of the vehicle on different roads. We are considering all
hazardous conditions to sense the disturbance along the three
axes. If the value is crossed over the respective axis then the
values will be sent to the mobile phone. By using Xilinx vivado a
comparator is designed with two inputs one is reference inputs
and other is the output of the system if the both the inputs are
equal and indicates that accident occurred. Then the latch will be
enabled. When the latch is enabled it will send the message which
consists of the following details: type of vehicle that is either two
wheeler or three wheeler or four wheeler , vehicle number and
the location.


● Seat Belt Locking System:
The sensor used for this seat belt buckle sensor or Reed sensor.
The sensor detects whether the seat belt buckle is latched or
unlatched, allowing the passenger safety system to determine the
optimum airbag deployment. It is also used as an input to the
electronic park brake and the unbuckled warning system.
Advantages: 1) Robust construction makes this sensor.
2) well suited to harsh environments.
3) No standby power required.
4) Can be connected directly to sounder or LED indicator.


● Door Locking System:
The safety locking system in the suggested system contains the
three main systems in it. They are an ultrasonic sensor, distance
measuring system and child safety lock. As the distance measuring
system utilizes the ultrasonic sensor for the measurement it is
used to identify not only the distance and also the speed of the
approaching vehicle. After the calculation of speed and distance of
the approaching vehicle, it is thus compared with the preset
conditions of speed distance for which the lock has to be
activated. According to the conditions made, the locking system
operates. When locking, indication is given only if all locks have
been locked and all doors are closed. Indication is given when the
last door has been closed.
